# **RoboCup Rescue 2023** - Stony Brook Robotics Team

## **RoboCup Rescue Description**
The Stony Brook Robotics Team (SBRT) plans to compete in the [RoboCup Rescue](https://rrl.robocup.org/) competition as part of [RoboCup 2023](https://2023.robocup.org/en/home/)! This is the repository where the code running on the [NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-nx/) that is on our robot.


## **File Structure of Repository**
Each primary folder corresponds to a different feature/functionality on the robot. Assume this repository will be cloned into the root directory of the Jetson. This means that when specifying file paths that point to locations outside of the repository, you shoud create them with respect to the root directory.


## **Developing Code**
Please try to avoid hardcoding values where possible, as this will make code results less reproducible. Also, please make an active effort to create modular and compact functions for code readability purposes.

## **If You Want to Contribute, Do This**
To contribute to this repository, you must be a Stony Brook University student. Please contact this year's Software Team Lead (Adit Anand) by Discord for questions on getting involved. You can get in contact with SBRT by dropping a line via the [SBRT website](https://sbroboticsteam.com/).
